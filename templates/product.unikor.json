For the first few nights, we recommend sleeping in the same room with your child to ensure they wake up when the alarm sounds and make it to the bathroom. Over time, they will naturally start waking up on their own. Tracking their progress with a reward chart—giving them stars for dry nights—can keep them motivated and boost their confidence."
